# README

> This is my portfolio web page that is built base on progressional grade Rails applications. All of my commit code here are coded through a real world approach to full stack coding.

### The technology includes:

* Backend development with Ruby on Rails 5

* front end coding with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery

* Database management: PostgreSQL working with a Rails application.

* Pivotal tracker to follow SCRUM project management

* Using Github for code commit.

* Deploy my application on the web with Heroku

* API Integration with Twitter API to pull in real time tweets into the portfolio application

* Create my own RubyGem from scratch and use it in my application

* Streaming Live Data/Page Updates with ActionCable

* Using advanced JavaScript features, for example, drag and drop functionality for users and build dynamic forms that change based on user input, all without a page refresh!

* Using Rails 5.2 encrypted credentials to securely manage configuration variables such as API and application secret keys.
